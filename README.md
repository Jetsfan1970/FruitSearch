# FruitSearch

A project I completed using ES2015 and Advanced Array methods. The user can type in a fruit name, and the search will display suggestions from a defined array of fruits and bold matching letters in the suggestions as the user types. The user can click on the fruit and it will populate the search input. If the user clears the input, they can search again. 

I created the JS and CSS for this project.
